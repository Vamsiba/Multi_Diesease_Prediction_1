# Multiple_Disease_Prediction_1
The Multiple Disease Prediction project aimed to build a machine learning-based web application that can predict the likelihood of various diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinsonâ€™s disease based on medical input data provided by the user. The project began with identifying and collecting appropriate datasets from reliable sources such as Kaggle and UCI Machine Learning Repository. These datasets contained relevant health parameters like glucose level, blood pressure, age, cholesterol, and others. After gathering the data, preprocessing was carried out to clean and standardize the data by handling missing values, normalizing the features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

Once the data was ready, separate machine learning models were trained for each disease using algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and K-Nearest Neighbors. The models were evaluated based on performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to choose the most effective model for each prediction task. After selecting the best models, they were integrated into a user-friendly web application using Streamlit. The interface allows users to input their medical data and instantly get predictions on whether they are at risk of any of the three diseases. The application was tested thoroughly with different input cases to ensure accuracy and usability. Finally, the entire system was deployed online, making it accessible for users to perform early disease detection, which can help in timely medical intervention.
